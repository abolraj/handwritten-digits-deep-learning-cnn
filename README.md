Welcome to the Handwritten Digit Recognition project! This repository contains code and resources for building and deploying a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can recognize handwritten digits, both from the standard MNIST dataset and real-time camera inputs.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the fascinating field of computer vision by creating a model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. We extend the traditional approach by:

- **Building a Custom CNN Architecture:** Tailored for accuracy and efficiency.
- **Implementing Advanced Preprocessing Techniques:** To handle real-world data variability.
- **Developing Interactive Applications:** Allowing users to draw digits or use their webcam for live recognition.

## üåü Features

- **Digit Recognition from Drawings:** Draw digits on a virtual canvas and get instant predictions.
- **Real-Time Camera Recognition:** Show handwritten digits to your webcam and see the model predict in real time.
- **Interactive User Interface:** User-friendly interfaces built with OpenCV for seamless interaction.
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy-to-understand and well-documented code for learning and extension.

## üñ•Ô∏è Demo

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `model_training/`: Scripts and notebooks for training the CNN model.
- `digit_recognition_draw.py`: Application to draw digits and get predictions.
- `digit_recognition_camera.py`: Application to recognize digits from webcam input.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abolraj/handwritten-digits-deep-learning-cnn.git
cd handwritten-digits-deep-learning-cnn
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*The `requirements.txt` file includes packages like TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.*

## üìö Usage

### 1. Training the Model

If you wish to train the model yourself:

```bash
cd model_training
python train_model.py
```

*This script will train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and save the trained model as `improved_trained_model.h5`.*

### 2. Digit Recognition by Drawing

Run the application where you can draw digits:

```bash
python digit_recognition_draw.py
```

**Instructions:**

- **Draw:** Click and drag the mouse to draw a digit.
- **Predict:** Release the mouse button to see the predicted digit.
- **Clear:** Press the 'c' key to clear the canvas.
- **Exit:** Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

### 3. Real-Time Digit Recognition with Camera

Run the application that uses your webcam:

```bash
python digit_recognition_camera.py
```

**Instructions:**

- **Display Digit:** Write a digit on a piece of paper and hold it up to the webcam within the designated rectangle.
- **Prediction:** The model will predict the digit and display it on the screen.
- **Exit:** Press the 'q' key to exit the application.

## ü§ñ How It Works

### Model Architecture

- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract spatial features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality and computation.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification based on extracted features.
- **Activation Functions:** Use ReLU for non-linear transformations and softmax for output probabilities.

### Preprocessing Steps

- **Grayscale Conversion:** Simplifies computation by reducing color channels.
- **Gaussian Blurring:** Reduces noise in the image.
- **Thresholding:** Converts images to binary for easier contour detection.
- **Contour Detection:** Finds the digit in the image for cropping and resizing.
- **Normalization:** Scales pixel values to be between 0 and 1.

## üîç Examples

### Drawing Recognition

*Drawing the digit '5' on the canvas and the model predicts it correctly.*

### Camera Recognition
